# 01 HTML CSS Git: Password Generator Homework_Three: Uconn Coding Bootcamp


As a beginner introduction to html refactoring we were tasked with an HTML file and "cleaning up" the code for the need of a client.


## The Assignment

```
CLIENT: A marketing agency
REQUEST: Clean the coding that follows accessibility standards for HTML5
DELIVERABLE: A site is optimized for any search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
